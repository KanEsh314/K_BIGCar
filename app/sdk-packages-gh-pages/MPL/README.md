Mobile Payment Library
======================

## Adaptive Payments moving to limited release

Adaptive Payments is now a limited release product. It is restricted to select partners for approved use cases and should not be used for new integrations without guidance from PayPal.

Those building new integrations should consider using [Braintree Payments](https://www.braintreepayments.com/), a PayPal Company, which is the easiest way to accept PayPal, credit cards, and many other payment methods.
